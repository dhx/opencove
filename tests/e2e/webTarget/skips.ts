// Tests of the Electron E2E suite that the web target (OPENCOVE_E2E_TARGET=web,
// playwright.e2e-web.config.ts) does not run. Each entry names the spec file (relative to tests/e2e)
// and, optionally, a test title in it (no title = the whole file). A title may be a literal fragment
// of a templated title (e.g. one that varies by theme); it then covers every variant. Kept honest by
// tests/unit/e2e/webTargetSkips.spec.ts, which fails when a file or title no longer exists.
//
// Categories:
// - electron-only: the test drives the Electron main process, native dialogs/menus, BrowserWindow,
//   desktop restart semantics or OS integration that the Web UI does not have.
// - electron-native-input: relies on Electron's clipboard/nativeImage or native file paths for input
//   (image paste, OS file drop); the Web UI's own path is covered by a web test in tests/e2e-web-canvas.
// - desktop-only-feature: a feature the Web UI does not offer by decision (e.g. the issue report).
// - by-design: the fork's worker or Web UI refuses what the spec does on purpose (docs/dhx/RELEASES.md).
// - web-ui-gap: the Web UI lacks an API the spec uses to set up its scene; remove the entry when the
//   Web UI gains it (canvas images are being added).
// - web-ui-bug: a real difference in the Web UI that should be fixed there (listed in RELEASES.md).
// - known-failing: fails in web mode for a reason not yet sorted out.
